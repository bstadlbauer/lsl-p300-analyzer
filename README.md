# P300
A tool for teaching P300 by showing the ongoing averaging process and continous classification.

## Packages
It is split up into two packages, one presenting a P300 speller, the other analysing the output of the speller and incoming 
EEG to perform classification. Connections are made via the [LSL](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer) interface. 
Technically, this package supports all EEG recorders capable of streaming to LSL, however, at the moment it is optimized to 
work with [eego sports](https://www.ant-neuro.com/products/eego_sports) by ANT neuro. 

## Documentation
This project is currently in the beta stage and is not documented yet. Documentation is supposed to come by the end of  
January 2019.
